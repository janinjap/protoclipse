   <description url="http://code.google.com/p/protoclipse/">
      The protoclipse plug-in generates java code from Google Protocol Buffers &quot;.proto&quot; files. 
To make full use of the generated code, the Google Protocol Buffers jar files must be available to the project (e.g., as a library dependency.) 
For more information about Google Protocol Buffers see http://code.google.com/p/protobuf/.
